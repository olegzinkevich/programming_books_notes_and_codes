# Weâ€™ll begin with constants to define the start and end of the sentence as <s> and </s>
# (because English reads left to right, the left_pad_symbol and right_pad_symbol,
# respectively). In languages that read right to left, these could be reversed.
# The second part of the code creates a function nltk_ngrams that uses the partial
# function to wrap the nltk.ngrams function with our code-specific keyword arguments.
# This ensures that every time we call nltk_ngrams, we get our expected behavior,
# without managing the call signature everywhere in our code that we use it. Finally
# our newly redefined ngrams function takes as arguments a string containing our text
# and n-gram size. It then applies the sent_tokenize and word_tokenize functions to
# the text before passing them into nltk_ngrams to get our padded n-grams
