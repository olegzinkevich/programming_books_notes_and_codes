# Where does SciPy
# come into the picture? It’s a package that utilizes NumPy arrays and manipulations to
# take on standard problems that scientists and engineers commonly face: integration,
# determining a function’s maxima or minima, finding eigenvectors for large sparse
#     matrices, testing whether two distributions are the same, andmuch more.
