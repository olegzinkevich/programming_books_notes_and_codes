re.match() and re.search() functions are used to find the patterns
and then can be processed according to the requirements of the application.
Let’s look at the differences between re.match() and re.search():

• re.match(): This checks for a match of the string only
at the beginning of the string. So, if it finds the pattern
at the beginning of the input string, then it returns the
matched pattern; otherwise; it returns a noun.

• re.search(): This checks for a match of the string
anywhere in the string. It finds all the occurrences of
the pattern in the given input string or data.
