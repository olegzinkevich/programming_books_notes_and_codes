    # A lower level, perhaps rudimentary way of getting performance statistics from your code is
    # through the use of code profiling tools. Python actually ships a code profiler as part of the
    # standard library known as cProfile. With cProfile already available to you, you can dive
    # straight into profiling your code and getting some stats. By using these tools, you can glean
    # useful performance information, such as which methods and classes have the most calls. You
    # can also get information such as the time spent in those methods, so by using these stats you
    # can determine problem areas in your code that you could perhaps refactor and break down
    # into more efficient calls

    # If you donâ€™t have a main method such as the preceding example to start your application, to run
    # the profile you pass the cProfile library as a parameter to Python when calling your Python script:
    # $ python -m cProfile bank_app.py
