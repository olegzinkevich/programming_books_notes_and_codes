Using treq
treq is a Python package that tries to be the equivalent of the Python requests
package for Twisted-based applications. It allows us to perform GET, POST, and
other HTTP requests easily. To install it, we use pip install treq, but it's already
preinstalled in our dev

A pipeline that writes to Elasticsearch
We will start with a spider that writes Items on an ES (Elasticsearch) server.
You may feel that starting with ES—even before MySQL—as a persistence mechanism
is a bit unusual, but it's actually the easiest thing one can do. ES can be schema-less,
which means that we can use it without any configuration. treq is also sufficient for
our (very simple) use case. If we need more advanced ES functionality, we should
consider using txes2 and other Python/Twisted ES packages.
