Every now and then you might have to write Spider middlewares. They process
Requests just after the spider and before any downloader middleware and Responses
in the opposite order. With a downloader middleware you may, for example, decide
to rewrite all your URLs to use HTTPS instead of HTTP regardless of what a spider
extracts from pages. It implements functionality that is specific to your project's needs
and shared across all spiders. The main thing that differentiates between downloader
middlewares and spider middlewares is that when a downloader middleware gets a
Request, it should return a single Response.
