Two-direction crawling with a CrawlSpider

If you felt that this two-direction crawling was a bit too tedious, then you are
really getting it. Scrapy tries to simplify all those very common cases, and makes
them easier to code. The easiest way to achieve the same results is by using a
CrawlSpider, a class that allows easier implementation of such crawls. To do so, we
will use the genspider command, setting a -t crawl parameter in order to create a
spider using the crawl spider template:

$ scrapy genspider -t crawl easy web

Created spider 'crawl' using template 'crawl' in module:
properties.spiders.easy

Now the file properties/spiders/easy.py
