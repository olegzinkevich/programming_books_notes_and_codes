Creating contracts

Contracts are a bit like unit tests for spiders. They allow you to quickly know if
something is broken. For example, let's assume that you wrote a scraper a few weeks
ago, and it had several spiders. You want to quickly check if everything is okay
today. Contracts are included in the comments just after the name of a function
(docstring), and they start with @. Let's look at the following contract for example:

def parse(self, response):
    """ This function parses a property page.
    @url http://web:9312/properties/property_000000.html
    @returns items 1
    @scrapes title price description address image_urls
    @scrapes url project spider server date
    """

The preceding code says, "check this URL and you should find one item with values
on those fields I enlist". Now if you run scrapy check, it will go and check whether
the contracts are satisfied:

$ scrapy check basic

OK

A contract might fail because either the spider code is broken, or some of the XPath
expressions are out-of-date with the URL you are checking against.
