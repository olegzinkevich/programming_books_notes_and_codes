Chrome, you will see that
the HTML code for this page doesn't contain any information relevant to properties.
Where does this data come from?

In these cases your next step is, as usual, to open the Network tab of Chrome's
debugger (5) to find out what's going on. In the list on the left, we can see all the
requests that Chrome performed to load this page. In this simple page, there are
only three requests: static/ that we already checked, jquery.min.js that retrieves the
code for a popular Javascript framework, and api.json which seems interesting. If
we click on it (6) and we then click the Preview tab on the right (7), we will notice
that it contains the data we have been looking for.
