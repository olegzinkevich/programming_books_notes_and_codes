You can test a free proxy by searching through HMA's public proxy list
(http://proxylist.hidemyass.com/).

Crawlera is a service by Scrapinghub and lead developers of Scrapy that acts
like a very clever proxy. Apart from using a large pool of IPs behind the scenes
to route your requests, it also adjusts the delays and retries failures to give you a
stable stream of successful responses as much as possible while remaining as fast
as possible. It's essentially a scraper's dream come true, and you can use it just by
setting the http_proxy environment variable as before:
$ export http_proxy=myusername:mypassword@proxy.crawlera.com:8010

Pricing starts from 25$
